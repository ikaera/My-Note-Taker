// HTML routes:
// GET /notes should return the notes.html file.
// GET * should return the index.html file.

// API routes:
// GET /api/notes should read the db.json file and return all saved notes as JSON.
// POST /api/notes should receive a new note to save on the request body, add it to the db.json file, and then return the new note to the client. You'll need to find a way to give each note a unique id when it's saved (look into npm packages that could do this for you).

app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`App is listening at http://localhost:${PORT} ðŸš€`)
// Bonus:
// DELETE /api/notes/:id should receive a query parameter containing the id of a note to delete. In order to delete a note, you'll need to read all notes from the db.json file, remove the note with the given id property, and then rewrite the notes to the db.json file.
